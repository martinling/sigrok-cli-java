sigrok-cli-java
---------------

This is an unofficial re-implemntation of the sigrok-cli tool, written using
experimental Java bindings for libsigrok.

This project is intended to:

 - provide an easy means of testing the sigrok Java bindings without writing
   many custom programs.

 - test and demonstrate the ease of use of the sigrok Java API.

 - allow new features for sigrok-cli to be prototyped quickly.

 - allow bugs in sigrok-cli (as opposed to underlying libraries) to be verified
   by comparing to an alternative implementation.

It is not intended to:

 - reproduce the exact behaviour of sigrok-cli (e.g. human readable text output
   or error messages).

 - replace sigrok-cli as the "official" command line client of the sigrok
   project.

Building & Running
------------------

First, install the libsigrok java bindings (instructions below assume in /usr/local).

Also download the most recent argparse4j jar file from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/argparse4j/files/

To build:

$ javac -classpath /usr/local/share/java/sigrok-core.jar:argparse4j.jar:. SigrokCLI.java 

To run:

$ java -classpath /usr/local/share/java/sigrok-core.jar:argparse4j.jar:. -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib/jni SigrokCLI
